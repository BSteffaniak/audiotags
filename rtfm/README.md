# **audiotags**: The Manual

This is the manual of the crate **audiotags** based on [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) (I know it's uncommon in the Rust community not to use **mdbook**, but trust me, **bookdown** is just so much powerful and you should definitely try it; at the minimum, it automatically generates LaTeX output by default).
